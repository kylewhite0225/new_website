						<h2>ABOUT KYLE</h2>
						<h4>MANUFACTURING & MECHANICAL ENGINEER</h4>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							I have 4 years of experience as a manufacturing engineer in the aerospace industry, 
							one year with Hexcel Composites and three with AvtechTyee Aerospace.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							At Hexcel, I focused on 5-axis CNC machining of honeycomb composite structures and 
							their associated tooling design. My role at AvtechTyee as a manufacturing engineer 
							involved the process design, process planning, CNC machine programming, new product 
							introduction, and continuing production engineering support of 
							structural aircraft components.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							While attending WWU, I was involved as the lead suspension engineer and CNC machinist for
							 <a rel="nofollow" href = "https://wwuracing.com">WWU Racing's</a> Viking 58. My suspension
							designs were successfully utilized for three generations of competition vehicles, and I 
							graduated from Western honored as the manufacturing engineering department's 
							outstanding graduate with cumulative GPA of 3.7.

						</p>

						<h4>COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT</h4>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							In April of 2020, the pandemic brought an unexpected change to my life (unemployment)
							which allowed me to act on career priorities that I had been re-evaluating for some time.
							My goal is to transition my career into environmental restoration using engineering
							and technology in order to use my skills for the mitigation of climate change.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							In June of 2020, I applied for the B.S. program in computer science at Bellevue College
							and immediately began taking courses in Java, C++, algorithms, data structures, software
							engineering, and database systems. My projected graduation date is June 2022 and my current
							GPA is 3.97.

								<h4>Pagani Zonda Surface CAD</h4>
								<div class="portfolio-text">
									<p style="text-align: justify">
									This is a surface CAD model built in CATIA using
									a 3D scan of a toy Pagani Zonda. The 3D scan data was
									captured as a point cloud, converted into a mesh structure, and
									then a set of wireframe geometry was built upon this structure.
									Surfaces were generated from this wireframe geometry using
									various techniques and materials were applied for rendering.

										ribs have been added to ensure that the vehicle can still
										move under power with backup drive pins
										in the case of a failure that may reduce
										the drive friction at the interface between the wheel hub
										and the wheel. A constant velocity interface is integrated underneath.

								<h3>WWU Racing Viking 58</h3>
								<div class="portfolio-text">
									<p style="text-align: justify">
										This is the completed viking 58 race car which was
										brought to competition in Lincoln, NE in June of 2017, one year
										after I graduated. The chassis of the vehicle is composed of 
										a carbon fiber composite monocoque and a steel tube subframe.
										The vehicle is powered by a 600cc Honda CBR RR engine, with
										a custom intake manifold governed by a regulatory 10 mm 
										restriction. The supsension is composed of
										a double wishbone setup with rocker actuated Cane Creek air dampers
										normally fitted on mountain bikes. Each corner package consists of
										a custom upright, spindle, bearing package, wheel hub, 
										and braking interface (designed by myself), as well as the 
										brake rotors and Wilwood brakes. The suspension components were 
										used on two more successive generations of vehicles. All components
										were modeled, analyzed, assembled, and simulated using CATIA.

								<h4>Viking 58 Front Suspension</h4>
								<div class="portfolio-text">
									<p style="text-align: justify">
										Pictured is the outboard view of the front suspension,
										with the front wheel hub, spindle, brake rotor,
										brake caliper, and carbon fiber chassis visible. The 
										rotor and wheel hub are pocketed extensively for the reduction
										of weight and for better heat dissipation as the brakes convert
										kinetic energy into heat energy during stopping. The 7075-T6 aluminum 
										hub has been hard anodized for surface durability, and the 4340 steel
										spindle has been bored through for weight reduction. The aluminum
										wheel hub is mounted to the steel spindle via an interference fit,
										and the brake calipter is mounted with waterjet steel bracket
										that is visible in the next picture below.

										Pictured is the engine bay of my 1988 BMW 325is that I picked up

										During the Spring of 2020, I embarked on a complete refurbishment
										of the top end of the engine accompanied by a thorough steam clean of the engine bay,
										with fresh powdercoating on many of the visible components.
